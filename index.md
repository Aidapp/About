# Aidapp
At Aidapp, our mission is to  empower Businesses to help them grow and achieve more. 

Aidapp is defined by its culture to solve the problems that we most care about - Help everyone to achieve more. We believe in creating great opportunities by providing solutions in Mobile and Web Development, UI/UX, and Digital Marketing. Our core mission is to impart affordable and simple solutions to small Startups and Individuals who need it the most but cannot afford to sustain in the competing Tech world. A lot of people who start something new face tough problems - and we feel for their passion, optimism and curiosity, the same that help us personally grow the most. 
Aidapp's primary vision is to aid NGO's and Non-Profit Organisations by providing Internet-based solutions for their outreach and growth.  

We currently work from Davis (CA) , Bangalore (IN) and  want to create a supportive and collaborative environment, so that we can learn, build and grow together and move the world forward.
